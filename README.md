# Magic: The Gathering Deck Builder

## Description
This Magic: The Gathering web application was developed using **.NET** for the backend and **Blazor** for the frontend. The platform allows users to build and manage multiple decks by saving individual cards to personalized collections. All card data is sourced from a **Microsoft SQL Server** database, ensuring efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of game-related data. Users can seamlessly create, update, and manage their decks using the intuitive interface.

The project provided valuable experience in developing and consuming APIs in .NET, with various approaches explored, including **minimal APIs**, **WebAPIs**, and **GraphQL**. The frontend, built using **Blazor**, connects to the backend APIs, creating a cohesive and dynamic user experience. We also integrated **MongoDB** to handle user data and deck storage, providing a scalable and flexible solution for managing card collections.

## Features

### Backend:
- **.NET API**: Multiple API approaches including minimal APIs, WebAPIs, and GraphQL.
- **Microsoft SQL Server**: Manages card details and ensures fast and efficient data retrieval.
- **MongoDB**: Stores user information and their personalized decks.

### Frontend:
- **Blazor**: Provides a dynamic and interactive UI for managing decks and browsing cards.
- **API Integration**: Seamless interaction between the backend APIs and the Blazor frontend for smooth data flow.
  
### User Functionality:
- Browse Magic: The Gathering cards from the database.
- Create, update, and delete decks.
- Add or remove cards from decks.
- Save and manage personalized card collections.

## Technologies Used

### Backend:
- **.NET**: For API development, using multiple styles like minimal APIs, WebAPIs, and GraphQL.
- **Microsoft SQL Server**: For card database management.
- **MongoDB**: To store user information and deck collections.

### Frontend:
- **Blazor**: To build a responsive and interactive UI for deck management.
- **C#**: Language used for both backend and frontend development.

### Others:
- **GraphQL**: For flexible querying of data.
- **Minimal API**: For lightweight and fast API operations.

## Lessons Learned

This project marked our first large-scale experience with .NET and Blazor. We gained hands-on experience in developing and consuming APIs, working with multiple API types (minimal API, WebAPI, and GraphQL), and connecting them to a frontend. We also learned how to manage both relational and non-relational databases (SQL Server and MongoDB) in a real-world application. The project solidified our knowledge of full-stack development and enhanced our teamwork and problem-solving abilities.

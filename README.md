# Magic: The Gathering Deck Builder

## Description
This Magic: The Gathering web application was developed using **.NET** for the backend and **Blazor** for the frontend. The platform allows users to build and manage multiple decks by saving individual cards to personalized collections. All card data is sourced from a **Microsoft SQL Server** database, ensuring efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of game-related data. Users can seamlessly create, update, and manage their decks using the intuitive interface.

The project provided valuable experience in developing and consuming APIs in .NET, with various approaches explored, including **minimal APIs**, **WebAPIs**, and **GraphQL**. The frontend, built using **Blazor**, connects to the backend APIs, creating a cohesive and dynamic user experience. We also integrated **MongoDB** to handle user data and deck storage, providing a scalable and flexible solution for managing card collections.
